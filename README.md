# Portfolio Mobile Setup

## Description

In this Portfolio Mobile Setup, I did the following

- Added the page layout in the index.html file
- Added styling by designing as much as possible (e.g. font, colors, images, tests, margins) using the [template 1 in    Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1) .
- Ensured there was no linter error.
